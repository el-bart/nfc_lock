# NFC lock

NFC-based, battery-powered lock for drawers, closets, etc.
android app used to control the module.

## done

* android app communicating with NFC both ways.


## TODO

* PCB with M24SR + STM8S003xx.

* SW for controlling 2 servo mechanisms.
* 3D-printed box for servo and battery mounting.


## ideas / improvements

* configurable servos' min/max positions.
* android app look-and-feel update... ;)
* use ATECC508A crypto chip for limiting access to drawer/lock.
