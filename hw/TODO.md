# TODO list

* PCB antena / m24sr does not seem to work at the moment...
  * C40, C41 from dev board? check if this helps.
  * bottom layer wiring goes in a wrong direction!
  * ANT10, instead (single-sided).
* 1uF + 100nF + 100pF for NFC's Vcc decoupling.
* 4.7uF for general Vcc decoupling.
* add external pull-ups for I2C.
